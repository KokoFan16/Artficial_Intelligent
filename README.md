# Artficial_Intelligent

This repository includes solutions for several classical questions in artficial interlligent.
The solutions are implemented by python.

1) Donald knuth conjecture

Give a positive integer as input, and another positive integer as target. You can only use some combination of the factorial, square root, and floor functions for input to get the target. The output should be the action sequence. 

For example: 

Input: 4 

Target: 5

Output: factorial, factorial, root, root, root, root, root, floor.
